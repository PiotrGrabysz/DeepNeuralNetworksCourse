# Deep Neural Networks

I assign here homeworks and projects realised during the Deep Neural Networks course (Głębokie sieci neuronowe in polish), held in 2020 summer semester.

## Short description of the content:

### Exercises

It consists of a few simple exericses intended to show how to code neural nets in pure numpy.

### Project1

The goal of this project was to train a classifier able to recognize pictures of 28 celebrities. 

### Project2

The goal of this project was to do image segmentation - given the picture of a person the network should mark all the pixels where this person is. U-net architecture is used for this purpose. I moved this project to a separate directory, because apart from the jupyter notebook I used several scripts which are run in the jupyter notebook.

### Project3

The goal of this project was to train a classifier (LSTM architecture) on four different classes on time series on two dimensional lattice.
